Hey! So, I made this super simple to-do list thing for keeping track of stuff you gotta do. <br>
It's got this cool, color-changing background that's kinda nice to look at, and it works on your phone or your computer, whatever you're using.<br>

Putting things on the list is easy – just type it in and hit 'Add Task.' When you finish something? Just click the little box, and it crosses it off – feels good! If you need to change a task, just hit 'Change,' 
and you can rewrite it, say if it's 'really important' (high), 'kinda important' (medium), or 'whenever' (low) – it even puts a little color line next to it. You can also add a 'do it by' date.<br>
If you miss it? It'll just show up in red so you don't forget.<br>

Getting rid of a task is just a click on 'Remove.' And when you've done a bunch of things, you can just hit 'Delete All Completed' to clean up the list.<br>
The best part? It remembers everything, even if you close the page and come back later! Plus, if you want, it can even try to remind you about deadlines with little pop-ups on your screen.<br>

Basically, it's just a straightforward way to keep your tasks in one place without being complicated or boring.<br>
